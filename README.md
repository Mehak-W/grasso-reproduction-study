# Grasso et al. (2023) Reproduction Study

## Overview

Computational reproduction of machine learning methodology from Grasso et al. (2023) "Signal Peptide Efficiency: From High-Throughput Data to Prediction and Explanation" published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*.

### Research Objectives
1. **Science Goal**: Reproduce Grasso et al. Random Forest methodology for signal peptide efficiency prediction
2. **Science Goal**: Identify factors affecting computational reproducibility in biological machine learning
3. **Science Goal**: Provide framework for reproduction studies in computational biology
4. **Learning Goal**: Demonstrate advanced Python and data science skills in biological applications

## Scientific Background

Signal peptides are short amino acid sequences (15-30 residues) that direct proteins to the secretory pathway in bacterial cells. The efficiency of this process varies significantly between sequences, affecting protein production in biotechnology applications.

The original Grasso study developed a Random Forest regression model to predict signal peptide secretion efficiency using 156 physicochemical features derived from experimental screening of ~12,000 variants in *Bacillus subtilis*.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or download repository
cd grasso-reproduction-study

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Requirements
Place the Grasso dataset in the main project directory. The analysis supports both formats:

**CSV Format (Recommended):**
- File: `sb2c00328_si_011.csv`
- Faster loading and processing
- Should contain ~11,643 rows and ~198 columns

**Excel Format (Original):**
- File: `sb2c00328_si_011.xlsx`
- Original supplementary file from Grasso et al.
- Uses 'Library_w_Bins_and_WA' sheet (second sheet)
- Requires openpyxl package (included in requirements.txt)

**Dataset Contents:**
- 11,643 signal peptide variants with experimental data
- 156 validated physicochemical features
- WA (weighted average) secretion efficiency scores
- Signal peptide amino acid sequences (SP_aa)

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```python
# Simple interactive execution
python quick_run.py
# Select option 1 for complete analysis
```

### Basic Reproduction Analysis
```python
# Execute complete reproduction study
python grasso_reproduction_tool.py

# Or in Python/Jupyter:
from grasso_reproduction_tool import execute_grasso_reproduction
results = execute_grasso_reproduction()
```

### Data Verification (Recommended First Step)
```python
# Verify data integrity before analysis
python data_verification_tool.py

# Or programmatically:
from data_verification_tool import comprehensive_data_verification
verified_data = comprehensive_data_verification()
```

## Methodology

### Feature Set
Uses exactly 156 validated physicochemical features from Grasso supplementary Table S2:
- **N-region features**: Amino-terminal region properties (24 features)
- **H-region features**: Hydrophobic core properties (14 features)  
- **C-region features**: Carboxy-terminal region properties (29 features)
- **Ac-region features**: Post-cleavage region properties (25 features)
- **SP-region features**: Global signal peptide properties (24 features)
- **Cleavage site features**: Position-specific amino acid indicators (40 features)

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Quality Control**: Applies Grasso filtering criteria
   - Non-missing WA scores and sequences
   - Signal peptide length: 10-40 amino acids
   - WA values: 1.0-10.0 (valid experimental range)

2. **Stratified Sampling**: Ensures representative test sets across performance ranges

3. **Intelligent Preprocessing**: Domain-specific data preparation
   - Feature scaling (if scale differences > 100Ã—)
   - Target transformation (if distribution significantly skewed)

4. **Model Training**: Random Forest with exact Grasso hyperparameters
   - 75 estimators, max_depth=25
   - Optimized for biological feature interactions

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Primary reproduction benchmark
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Variance explained assessment  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Interpretable error metric
- **Cross-validation**: Model stability evaluation
- **Feature importance**: Biological validation analysis

## Results

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Target MSE**: 1.22 WAÂ² (Grasso et al. original result)
- **Achieved MSE**: [Results from analysis]
- **Biological validation**: Feature importance alignment with known signal peptide biology

### Outputs Generated
1. **Comprehensive visualization**: `grasso_reproduction_results.png` (4-panel analysis figure)
2. **Detailed metrics**: Complete performance assessment in console output
3. **Feature importance**: Biological validation analysis
4. **Research findings**: Optional detailed interpretation with `research_findings_analysis.png`
